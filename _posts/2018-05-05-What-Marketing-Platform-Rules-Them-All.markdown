Most businesses spend around 10% of their gross revenue on marketing. Larger and more successful businesses will tend to spend more.

Spending that much of your revenue on marketing can be scary, especially since often the return on this investment is not easily measured or tangibly seen. Spending the money can be less scary though when researching the best means of marketing for the current context.

It is not news that the internet has dramatically shifted our markets. These new forms of engagement have turned marketing strategies upside down on their heads. Before the internet it was easy to target audiences because there were only a few channels of exposure: billboards, TV commercials, and print advertisements. Nowadays however, consumers are active on thousands of different websites and mobile applications, and as such, it can be hard to identify where best to put your advertising dollars. However, throughout these emergences and comedowns of different applications, there is one way of showing off your brand that has and will remain stagnant: your personal website.

Think about it. Within the past decade we have seen the rise and fall of many different social media applications and channels. Snapchat and Twitter used to be king, however now most strategists would not recommend putting advertising dollars on there. Platforms such as Facebook are wildly popular, however this popularity has only emerged in the past few years, and its ability to endure our consumers shortening attention spans is uncertain.

Despite the longevity of these platforms’ popularity being unknown, one means of branding has remained present since the beginning of the internet, which is the personal website.

Its longevity makes sense.

Despite different platforms going in and out of style, you are always able to link to your website through these platforms. If a customer sees your product through Instagram, and wants to buy it or investigate it more, they will end up on your personal website through a link on your Instagram profile.

So, where will you put your marketing dollars? Platforms like Instagram and Facebook do have their merit and will definitely help bring you customers, but when it comes down to the customers and clients that are going to engage with your business, they will end up on your website. It’s safe to say that building a good website for your business is a solid investment.
