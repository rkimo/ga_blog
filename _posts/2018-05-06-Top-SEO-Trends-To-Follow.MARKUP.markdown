### 1. Increased Page Relevance

Google has been improving its ways to get its users to their desired *content* faster and faster. Lately, this means a lot of innovation in finding the users search *intent*-- even if it does not necessarily match their search query.

This means that search engines will evaluate the relevancy of your website's content, using methods such as Latent Semantic Indexing. Though LSI, Google can gather content from from your website and put a value on its comprehensibility.

Adhering to this, Google will worsen the ranking of any websites that are slow to load. In addition to this, Google  studies users "bounce rates". Where does user experience come into this? If your user cannot find the article they came to read, or the link they came to click, they will leave your website faster than if they were finding relevant information.
